# AI Chatbot Website

The project is a simple React application that uses Vite as the build tool and Google Gemini to power an AI chatbot. It's served from a Spring Boot backend.

The project currently has 3 characters that can be spoken to: 

 - Ken from the Barbie movie.

 - Spurgeon, a character I created after my brother humerously mispronounced the NHL player Jared Spurgeon's name to sound more like an Eevee evolution from pokemon (Spurgeon -> Spurgeeon).

 - Jinx from the Arcane series.

The project was create using Spring Boot 3, React 19, Vite 6.3.5, and Google Gemini
