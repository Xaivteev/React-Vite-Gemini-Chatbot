# React + Vite + Google Gemini Project

This is my first project to learn React and Vite. The project is a simple React application that uses Vite as the build tool and Google Gemini to power an AI chatbot.

The project currently has 2 characters that can be spoken to: 

 - Ken from the Barbie movie

 - Spurgeon, a character I created after my brother humerously mispronounced the NHL player Jared Spurgeon's name to sound more like an Eevee evolution from pokemon (Spurgeon -> Spurgeeon).

The project was create using React 19, Vite 6.3.5, and Google Gemini
